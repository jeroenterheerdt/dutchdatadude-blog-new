Now that Elon Musk owns Twitter, I am exploring alternatives. A while ago I came across [Twitodon](https://twitodon.com), which allows you to find the people you are following on Twitter (friends) on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org). 
Now, personally, I prefer to use [Counter.social](https://http://counter.social/). Unfortunately, I did not find a site that allowed me to find my friends from Twitter on Counter.social (CoSo for short).

Anyway, enter [Twitoso](https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/twitoso): a simple Python script that uses the Twitter API to get the username of your friends and saves them to a file. You can then import that file into CoSo to automatically follow the same friends, as long as they used the same username.

This is very basic and could be more intelligent, but it saved me a ton of time - hope it helps you as well. 

~I will be on Twitter for the foreseeable future, but you can now also find me on [Counter.social](http://counter.social/) as [@jaypowerbi](https://counter.social/web/accounts/135348#).~
Update: I am no longer on Twitter but on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/jaypowerbi.bsky.social
